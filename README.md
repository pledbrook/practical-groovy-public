# Practical Groovy

I'm planning to take a foray into the world of self-publishing with an introductory, example-focused book on [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/). While the book will require a purchase, I'll be making the initial drafts available via GitHub for free so that I can solicit feedback. For now, if you want to keep updated with new drafts, simply watch this repository.

The drafts are available as:

* [HTML](https://pledbrook.github.io/practical-groovy-public/)
* [PDF](https://pledbrook.github.io/practical-groovy-public/practical-groovy.pdf)

Remember that these are early drafts and not representative of the final book. But I genuinely hope that people will find them useful.
