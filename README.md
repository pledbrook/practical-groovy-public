# Practical Groovy

I'm planning to take a foray into the world of self-publishing with an introductory, example-focused book on [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/). While the book will require a purchase, I'll be making the initial drafts available via GitHub for free so that I can solicit feedback. For now, if you want to keep updated with new drafts, simply watch this repository.

The drafts are available as:

* [HTML](https://pledbrook.github.io/practical-groovy-public/)
* [PDF](https://pledbrook.github.io/practical-groovy-public/practical-groovy.pdf)

Remember that these are early drafts and not representative of the final book. If you would like to leave feedback in terms of improvements or fixes, please add via this project's GitHub Issues.

I hope that people find even the early drafts useful!
